## Jupyter Notebooks for Page Scraping

I was working on a reddit scraper to download data. It never came of anything but I managed to pick up a few decent techniques using python and beautifulsoup to parse out HTML. So when it came to be that I was asked to scrape some data out of a few web pages, figured I could use the knowledge from that reddit scraper for it. 

Being in charge of finding leads, lot of the work that I ended up doing has to do with parsing HTML on web pages to get structured data out of those pages. 

Each page is different depending on how the data was presented. 

## Tools Used: 
* urllib
* BeautifulSoup 
* Pandas
* Selenium with Google Chrome for screen scraping 

I am rather proud of the ASIS screen scraper, which goes to a web page, presents it for me to log in, and then uses Selenium to move through all the pages until the end. Then afterwards, I can use BeautifulSoup and Pandas to gather the data and export to CSV. 

## Next to do
They have a new Headless Chrome API that I would like to use some day but as long as Selenium works fine.
